## Quickstart

Three steps: install `blender-mcp` with pipx, point your MCP client at the server, install the Blender addon.

**1. Install blender-mcp with pipx**

```bash
# macOS
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath

# Linux
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath

# Windows
py -m pip install --user pipx
py -m pipx ensurepath
```

Then, in a new shell:

```bash
pipx install blender-mcp
```

> **Warning:** Do not proceed before installing pipx and running `pipx install blender-mcp`.

**2. Add the MCP server to your client**

<details open>
<summary><b>Claude Desktop</b> — Settings → Developer → Edit Config</summary>

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "blender": {
            "command": "blender-mcp"
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b></summary>

```bash
claude mcp add blender blender-mcp
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor / VS Code / OpenCode / Antigravity</b></summary>

See [MCP Client Setup](#mcp-client-setup) below for per-client instructions and one-click install buttons.
</details>

**3. Install the Blender addon**

```bash
blender-mcp install-addon
```

Then in Blender: **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons** → enable **Interface: Blender MCP**.

**4. Connect**

In Blender's 3D viewport, press `N` → open the **BlenderMCP** tab → click **Start MCP Server**. That's it — ask Claude to build something.

> **Note:** Only run **one** instance of the MCP server (either Cursor or Claude Desktop), not both.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **Two-way communication** | Connect Claude AI to Blender through a socket-based server |
| **Object manipulation** | Create, modify, and delete 3D objects in Blender |
| **Material control** | Apply and modify materials and colors |
| **Scene inspection** | Get detailed information about the current Blender scene |
| **Code execution** | Run arbitrary Python code in Blender from Claude |
| **Asset & model generation** | Poly Haven assets and Sketchfab models |

## Components

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Blender Addon** (`src/blender_mcp/bundled/addon/`) — a Blender addon that creates a socket server within Blender to receive and execute commands
2. **MCP Server** (`src/blender_mcp/server/`) — a Python server that implements the Model Context Protocol and connects to the Blender addon

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Blender** 5.1 or newer
- **Python** 3.13 or newer
- **pipx**

<details>
<summary><b>Installing pipx, per platform</b></summary>

**macOS**
```bash
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

**Windows**
```powershell
py -m pip install --user pipx
py -m pipx ensurepath
```

**Linux**
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

`pipx ensurepath` adds pipx's install location (and the binaries it installs) to your PATH — open a new shell after running it.

Otherwise, installation instructions are on their website: [Install pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/).

Then install the server itself:

```bash
pipx install blender-mcp
```
</details>

> **Warning:** Do not proceed before installing pipx and running `pipx install blender-mcp`.

### Make your client find blender-mcp

MCP clients started from a GUI (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code from the Dock/Start menu) do **not** inherit your terminal's PATH, so a bare `"command": "blender-mcp"` can fail with **`spawn blender-mcp ENOENT`** even though it works in your terminal. If that happens:

- Find blender-mcp's full path — `which blender-mcp` (macOS/Linux) or `where blender-mcp` (Windows) — and use it as `"command"`, e.g. `/Users/<you>/.local/bin/blender-mcp` or `C:\Users\<you>\.local\bin\blender-mcp.exe`.
- On Windows you can instead wrap it: `"command": "cmd", "args": ["/c", "blender-mcp"]`.
- After any PATH or config change, **fully quit and relaunch** the client (Windows: quit from the system tray, not just the window; macOS: <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd>).

### Pin the Python version

*Avoid conda / pyenv / version conflicts.*

On machines with conda (auto-activated base), pyenv, or asdf, `pipx install` can pick up an interpreter that makes installation fail. Pin the Python version pipx uses to build the server's environment:

```bash
pipx install blender-mcp --python python3.13
```

This still satisfies this package's `requires-python >=3.13`. (The repo's `.python-version` is only a hint for contributors and does **not** affect an already-published install.)

If a previous failed attempt keeps replaying after a fix, reinstall clean:

```bash
pipx reinstall blender-mcp
```

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the Blender connection:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BLENDER_HOST` | `localhost` | Host address for Blender socket server |
| `BLENDER_PORT` | `9876` | Port number for Blender socket server |

Example:

```bash
export BLENDER_HOST='host.docker.internal'
export BLENDER_PORT=9876
```

## MCP Client Setup

### Claude for Desktop

[Watch the setup instruction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neoK_WMq92g) (assuming you have already installed blender-mcp via pipx)

Go to **Claude → Settings → Developer → Edit Config → `claude_desktop_config.json`** and include the following:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "blender": {
            "command": "blender-mcp"
        }
    }
}
```

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b></summary>

Use the Claude Code CLI to add the blender MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add blender blender-mcp
```
</details>

### Cursor

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/link/mcp%2Finstall?name=blender&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoiYmxlbmRlci1tY3AifQ%3D%3D)

**macOS** — go to **Settings → MCP** and paste the following:

- To use as a global server, use the *"add new global MCP server"* button and paste
- To use as a project-specific server, create `.cursor/mcp.json` in the root of the project and paste

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "blender": {
            "command": "blender-mcp"
        }
    }
}
```

**Windows** — go to **Settings → MCP → Add Server**, add a new server with the following settings:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "blender": {
            "command": "cmd",
            "args": [
                "/c",
                "blender-mcp"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

[Cursor setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgWsJshecac)

> **Note:** Only run **one** instance of the MCP server (either on Cursor or Claude Desktop), not both.

### Visual Studio Code

*Prerequisites*: Make sure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed before proceeding.

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_blender--mcp_server-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=ffffff)](vscode:mcp/install?%7B%22name%22%3A%22blender-mcp%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22stdio%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22blender-mcp%22%7D)

### OpenCode

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "blender-mcp": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["blender-mcp"],
      "enabled": true,
      "environment": {
        "BLENDER_HOST": "localhost",
        "BLENDER_PORT": "9876"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Antigravity

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "blender-mcp": {
      "command": "blender-mcp",
      "env": {
        "BLENDER_HOST": "localhost",
        "BLENDER_PORT": "9876"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Installing the Blender Addon

**1. Recommended** — from a terminal, run:

```bash
blender-mcp install-addon
```

This copies the addon into your Blender addons folder as a `blender_mcp/` addon folder. It prints where it wrote to, and keeps a `.bak` copy of any existing install it replaces.

> Optional: `blender-mcp addon-paths` lists detected Blender addons folders. Override the destination with `BLENDERMCP_ADDONS_DIR=/path/to/scripts/addons`.

**2.** Open Blender

**3.** Go to **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons**

**4.** Enable **Interface: Blender MCP** (search "Blender MCP"). If it doesn't appear yet, restart Blender.

**5. Manual alternative** — if the command above can't find your Blender install, or you prefer doing it by hand: clone or download this repo, then in Blender, **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install…** → select the `src/blender_mcp/bundled/addon/` folder (or a zip of it) → enable it.

Then open the **BlenderMCP** tab in Blender's sidebar (press `N` in the 3D viewport) and click **Start MCP Server**. See [Starting the Connection](#starting-the-connection) below.

## Upgrading (existing users)

> For newcomers, go straight to [Quickstart](#quickstart). For existing users, see below.

**1.** Update the server, then the addon file:

```bash
pipx upgrade blender-mcp
blender-mcp install-addon
blender-mcp addon-paths   # optional: list detected Blender addons folders
```

**2.** In Blender: **Preferences → Add-ons** → disable and re-enable **Interface: Blender MCP** (or restart Blender), then click **Start MCP Server** again.

**3.** Delete the MCP server from Claude and add it back again if the server package itself needs a refresh.

> **Note:** the MCP server never modifies your Blender addon files on its own. When it starts, it checks whether the installed addon is behind the bundled copy and logs how to update; `install-addon` is what actually writes, and it keeps a `.bak` of the file it replaces.

---

## Usage

### Starting the Connection

![BlenderMCP in the sidebar](assets/addon-instructions.png)

1. In Blender, go to the 3D View sidebar (press <kbd>N</kbd> if not visible)
2. Find the **BlenderMCP** tab
3. Turn on the checkboxes you'd like to use (see more under [Capabilities](#capabilities) below)
4. Click **Connect to Claude**
5. Make sure the MCP server is running in your terminal

### Using with Claude

Once the config file has been set on Claude, and the addon is running on Blender, you will see a hammer icon with tools for the Blender MCP.

![BlenderMCP in the sidebar](assets/hammer-icon.png)

### Capabilities

- Get scene and object information
- Create, delete and modify shapes
- Create primitives and edit meshes directly (extrude, inset, bevel, bridge, boolean, subdivide, remesh, solidify)
- Higher-level modeling operations (mirror, array, radial array, symmetrize, blockout, refine, detail, match transform to a reference object)
- Apply or create materials for objects
- Execute any Python code in Blender
- Download the right models, assets and HDRIs through [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/)
- Search and download models from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/)

### Example Commands

Here are some examples of what you can ask Claude to do:

| Prompt | Demo |
|---|---|
| *"Create a low poly scene in a dungeon, with a dragon guarding a pot of gold"* | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqgKuLYUv00) |
| *"Create a beach vibe using HDRIs, textures, and models like rocks and vegetation from Poly Haven"* | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I29rn92gkC4) |
| Give a reference image, and create a Blender scene out of it | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDRb03XPiRo) |
| *"Get information about the current scene, and make a threejs sketch from it"* | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxbNI5L7AH8) |
| *"Make this car red and metallic"* | |
| *"Create a sphere and place it above the cube"* | |
| *"Make the lighting like a studio"* | |
| *"Point the camera at the scene, and make it isometric"* | |

---

## Persistent API Credentials

BlenderMCP supports persistent credentials via Blender Add-on Preferences:

**Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Blender MCP**

You can store these values there so they survive Blender restarts:

- Sketchfab API Key

For headless setups or CI, credentials can also be injected by environment variables:

| Variable |
|---|
| `BLENDERMCP_SKETCHFAB_API_KEY` |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| **Connection issues** | Make sure the Blender addon server is running, and the MCP server is configured on Claude. **Do not** run the `blender-mcp` command manually in the terminal outside your MCP client. Sometimes the first command won't go through, but after that it starts working. |
| **Timeout errors** | Try simplifying your requests or breaking them into smaller steps. |
| **Poly Haven integration** | Claude is sometimes erratic with its behaviour. |
| **Have you tried turning it off and on again?** | If you're still having connection errors, try restarting both Claude and the Blender server. |

## Technical Details

### Communication Protocol

The system uses a simple JSON-based protocol over TCP sockets:

- **Commands** are sent as JSON objects with a `type` and optional `params`
- **Responses** are JSON objects with a `status` and `result` or `message`

## Limitations & Security Considerations

> **Warning:** The `execute_blender_code` tool allows running arbitrary Python code in Blender, which can be powerful but potentially dangerous. Use with caution in production environments. **ALWAYS save your work before using it.**

- Poly Haven requires downloading models, textures, and HDRI images. If you do not want to use it, please turn it off in the checkbox in Blender.
- Complex operations might need to be broken down into smaller steps.
